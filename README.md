# Cobra-Utilities-Mod
Cobra Utilities is a mod made for cobra.gg to solve chat games like solving an equation or unscrambling a word. 

TODO:
make the mod only download knownwords.txt once.
make the mod only download moby.txt once.
automatically add the words it doesnt solve to knownwords.txt.
fix the solved message being sent immediately after it is solved.
make the mod solve words over 8 characters if the word is in knownwords.txt. (how do i do this without lagging the client while making all the permutations?)
remove a lot of debug println's
